Project Proposal: Knowledge and Advice App

Tech Stack:
We plan to utilize a modern and versatile tech stack for our project. The recommended choice is React for the front-end and Node for the back-end. However, we are open to using Python/Flask if a developer is inclined towards Python.

Focus:
The project will be a full-stack application with an even focus on both front-end UI and back-end functionality.

Platform:
The application will be designed as a responsive website, ensuring accessibility across various devices.

Project Goal:
The primary goal of our project is to create a platform that provides advice, basic knowledge, and support for adolescents and individuals of any age range in various areas of everyday life. We aim to foster a community where users can seek guidance and share experiences.

User Demographic:
Our target users include adolescents and individuals of diverse age groups seeking advice and information on a wide range of topics. The platform will be inclusive and cater to users from various backgrounds.

Data Plan:
We plan to incorporate diverse data sources, potentially using APIs or creating our own API. The data should cover a broad spectrum of topics, including but not limited to education, personal development, mental health, and everyday life advice.

Approach Outline:
1. Database Schema:
The database will include tables for users, posts, categories, and comments. User profiles will store relevant information, while posts will cover advice and knowledge-sharing.

2. API Issues:
We anticipate potential challenges with data quality if we create our own API or scrape data. We'll implement data cleaning processes to address this.

3. Sensitive Information:
User data privacy is a priority. We'll implement secure authentication and encryption to safeguard sensitive information.

4. Functionality:
The app will allow users to create profiles, post queries, provide advice, and engage in discussions. A voting system will highlight valuable advice. An intuitive search and categorization system will enhance user experience.

5. User Flow:
Users will register, create profiles, browse or search for topics of interest, post queries, and engage in discussions. The user interface will be designed for simplicity and ease of navigation.

6. Additional Features and Stretch Goals:

Implementing a recommendation engine for personalized advice.
Integrating multimedia content, such as videos and infographics.
Gamification elements to encourage user engagement.
This project aims to create a supportive community by leveraging technology to provide valuable advice and knowledge for users navigating the challenges of everyday life.



P.S: I was inspired by Reddit but also TikTok for this app because most adolescents or any other friends that I know use TikTok if they want to know which brand is on trend for the moment, which perfume to wear based on what they like but I wanted to create an app or website where people who already experience those things in life could give advice, where it could be like a diary advice.
